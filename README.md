# dependenceR
`dependenceR` is a _work in progress_ and is designed to be a package that helps
you map your R file(s) dependencies for packages and functions. Hopefully it'll
be a lot like [`pkgnet`](https://uptake.github.io/pkgnet/) but it will work on
single or multiple R files, whereas pkgnet is designed to map the dependencies
of an R package.

## Tasks:
- TODO document packages and functions loaded/created/called in R files
- TODO retrieve all functions for packages loaded
- TODO identify all function calls in R files
- TODO map called functions back to their source
- TODO report package and function dependencies
